## üìö Overview

This repository documents my journey through the intensive 42 Wolfsburg Piscine - a month-long coding bootcamp that serves as the selection process for 42's software engineering program. The Piscine (French for "swimming pool") is designed to immerse candidates in coding challenges, teaching fundamental programming concepts through intense daily assignments, weekly team projects (rushes), and exams.

During this challenging month, I learned:
- C programming fundamentals
- Shell scripting
- Problem-solving approaches
- Working under pressure
- Peer learning and collaboration

This repository contains my completed projects and curated resources that helped me succeed during this experience.

## üí° Tips for Future Pisciners

1. **Practice Time Management**: Plan your day to balance coding, researching, and rest
2. **Embrace the Peer Learning Model**: Don't hesitate to ask questions and help others
3. **Focus on Understanding**: Don't just copy solutions; understand the underlying concepts
4. **Build Good Habits**: Write clean, well-commented code from the beginning
5. **Keep Testing**: Test your code thoroughly with different inputs and edge cases
6. **Learn Git Early**: Version control will save you many headaches
7. **Rest Is Important**: A clear mind solves problems more efficiently than an exhausted one

## üìù Note on Repository Content

This repository contains completed projects and resources for future reference. The code showcases my progress and learning during the Piscine but may not represent perfect solutions in all cases. The intent is to document my journey and provide helpful resources for others going through similar experiences.
