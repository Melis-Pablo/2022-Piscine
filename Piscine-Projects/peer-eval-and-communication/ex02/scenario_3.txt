Scenario 3 - Unexpected Evaluation Sheet:

First i would try to understand if there where any mistakes i missed on my side,
if i found everything perfect i would kindly reach out to them to ask them about my mistakes,
they might point out some valid stuff and i would listen and made sure to correct those mistakes
going forward. Usually it is just miscommunication so i would just talk about it so we can 
understand eachother going forward.
