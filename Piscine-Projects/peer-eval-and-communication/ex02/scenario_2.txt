Scenario 2 - Evaluation Time Management:

I first would talk about the importance of checking everything properly, since as 
someone being evaluated it is really important to get the full feedback of the project
to learn as much as possible, and also as the evaluator it is important to check that
everything was done properly with no cheating, which means asking relevant questions on 
each exercise. I would also ask if there are some circumstance that won't allow them to continue 
longer with the evaluation. I would try to go as fast as possible while checking everything properly.
