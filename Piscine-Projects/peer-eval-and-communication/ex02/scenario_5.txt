Scenario 5 - Cheating?:

If person B has not cheated but is having some trouble they should be transparent about it, tell the evaluator 
if they are feeling uneasy and maybe ask them for a minute before answering to gather their thoughts. 

If person B is having trouble answering the questions person A should first tell them to relax, breathe a little and 
give them time to gather their thoughts, if this is the first evaluation it is more likely that they are 
nervous and are just having trouble finding the words. 

If they were cheating, Person A should kindly explain why exactly they think that person B cheated and give them
an opportunity to defend themselves in a calm manner, after that if person A still thinks Person B cheated,
person A should give them some advice on resources for that project or some advice about the learning proccess.
Leaving them not only with a cheating mark but also good advice on going forward.
