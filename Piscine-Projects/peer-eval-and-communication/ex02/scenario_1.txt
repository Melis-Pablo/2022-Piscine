Scenario 1 - Unresponsive Evaluator:

If the person evaluating my project does not show up at the set time, 
i would send them a message asking them if they were still available and if everything is ok,
sometimes unexpected things can happen so first i would message them to check on them and also ask
them if the needed more time before the evaluation, if after 15 min or more there is no answer i 
unfortunately would mark them as absent.
